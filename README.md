# Mountain Henning's Blog
Welcome to my blog! This is a Next.js statically generated website that utilizes MDX to create a dynamic and fast deploying blog.

### What is on here?
Whatever I am interested in. Right now I want to blog about my progress with two things:

- Flashmo
- Deep Learning with Python

### When will this be updated?
Boldy, I want to say daily, but realistically, weekly. I am thinking weekly progress updates on Flashmo and Chapter notes updates on Deep Learning with Python.

### I like the content, how do I get more connected with you?
Are you a hiring manager? Email me at mountainhenning@gmail.com
Otherwise, you can follow me on Twitter @mounthenning, or connect with me on Linkedin @tainhenning
